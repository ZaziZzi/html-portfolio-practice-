<h1>The best movies/series according to Mr Azizi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Metal Fusion</h3>

<p>Terrific series, arguably the best beyblade series ever.<br />
    Very nostalgic, entertained me very much as a child.</p>

<h3>A series of unfortunate events</h3>
    
<p>Loved this series back in 2018, very intriguing.</p>

<h3>Shrek - even the sequels</h3>

<p>A classic, top notch and hits the spot.<br />
    If movies were as top quality as shrek nowadays, I wouldn't have stopped watching them.</p>
